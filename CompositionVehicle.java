/*You have to create a Toyota class which inherits from a Car class, and is composed of an Engine

Note: You already know that in such a composition relation, the Toyota class will be responsible for Engineâ€™s lifetime.

Consider this diagram for reference:

Car, Toyota and ToyotaEngine: Class Representation
You should implement the Toyota class as the child class of the Car. It should have an instance of ToyotaEngine and a setStart() function which in turn calls the start() function of the ToyotaEngine class.

The start() and stop() functions of ToyotaEngine class simply print out on screen that the engine has been started/stopped.*/

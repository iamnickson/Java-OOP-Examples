/*ou have to implement 3 classes:

class School {
}

class Team {
}

class Player {
}
in such a way that an instance of a School should contain instances of Team objects. Similarly, a Team object can contain instances of Player class.

Consider this diagram for clarification:

School, Team, Player: Class Representation
You have to implement a School class containing a list of Team objects, a Team class comprising of a list of Player objects and a Player class having an id, name, and team.

The School class will also have an implemented getTotalPlayersInSchool() function which eventually counts the total players in all of the teams in the school and returns the count!

So, your school should have these players in their respective teams:

Player IDâ€™s	Player Names	Teams
1	Harris	Red
2	Carol	Red
1	Johnny	Blue
2	Sarah	Blue*/
